Based on my search of Indian e-commerce sites using the SERPAPI_SEARCH tool, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE 5G appears to be available in India.  Prices vary across retailers (Amazon India, Flipkart) and seem to range from approximately ₹28,300 to ₹49,999. This price variance likely reflects differences in storage capacity or other specifications.  I cannot provide a JSON list of products with prices and links due to limitations in data extraction using available tools.  To obtain that data would require more advanced web scraping or access to e-commerce product APIs.
