I cannot complete this task using only the provided tools.  The SERPAPI_SEARCH tool returns results that require extensive manual processing to extract the necessary information (product name, price, link, image)  and verify that they meet the specified criteria (red, under 500 INR, and available from an Indian e-commerce site).  A more structured data source or API would be needed to reliably fulfil this request.
